      <h2>Bankim Chandra Chatterjee</h2>
      <img src="-Bankimchandra_Chattapadhay.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Bankim Chandra Chatterjee or Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, CIE (27
        June 1838[1] – 8 April 1894[2]) was an Indian novelist, poet and
        journalist.[3] He was the composer of Vande Mataram, originally in
        Sanskrit, personifying India as a mother goddess and inspiring
        activists during the Indian Independence Movement. Chattopadhyay wrote
        fourteen novels and many serious, serio-comic, satirical, scientific
        and critical treatises in Bengali. He is known as Sahitya Samrat
        (Emperor of Literature) in Bengali. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Chattopadhyay is
        widely regarded as a key figure in literary renaissance of Bengal as
        well as the broader Indian subcontinent. Some of his writings,
        including novels, essays, and commentaries, were a breakaway from
        traditional verse-oriented Indian writings, and provided an
        inspiration for authors across India. <br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Chattopadhyay was
        born in the village of Kanthalpara in the town of North 24 Parganas,
        Naihati, in an orthodox Bengali Brahmin family, the youngest of three
        brothers, to Yadav Chandra Chattopadhyaya and Durgadebi. His ancestors
        hailed from Deshmukho village in Hooghly District.[4] His father, a
        government official, went on to become the Deputy Collector of
        Midnapur. One of his brothers, Sanjib Chandra Chattopadhyay was also a
        novelist and is known for his book "Palamau". Bankim Chandra and his
        elder brother both went to Hooghly Collegiate School (then
        Governmental Zilla School), where he wrote his first poem. He was
        educated at the Hooghly Mohsin College and later at Presidency
        College, Kolkata, graduating with a degree in Arts in 1858. He later
        attended the University of Calcutta and was one of two candidates who
        passed the final exam to become the school's first graduates.[5] He
        later obtained a degree in Law in 1869. Following his father's
        footsteps, Bankimchandra joined the Subordinate Executive Service. In
        1858, he was appointed a Deputy Magistrate (the same type of position
        held by his father) of Jessore. After merging of the services in 1863,
        he went on to become Deputy Magistrate & Deputy Collector, retiring
        from government service in 1891. His years at work were replete with
        incidents that brought him into conflict with the colonial government.
        He was, however, made a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the
        Indian Empire (CMEOIE) in 1894.[6] He also received the title of Rai
        Bahadur in 1891. <br />

        may be challenged and removed. (April 2017) (Learn how and when to
        remove this template message) Chattopadhyay's earliest publications
        were in Ishwar Chandra Gupta's weekly newspaper Sangbad Prabhakar.[7]
        He began his literary career as a writer of verse before turning to
        fiction. His first attempt was a novel in Bengali submitted for a
        declared prize. He did not win and the novelette was never published.
        His first fiction to appear in print was the English novel Rajmohan's
        Wife.[8] Durgeshnandini, his first Bengali romance and the first ever
        novel in Bengali, was published in 1865. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the many
        novels of Chattopadhyay that are entitled to be termed as historical
        fiction is Rajsimha (1881, rewritten and enlarged 1893). Anandamath
        (The Abbey of Bliss, 1882) is a political novel which depicts a
        Sannyasi (Hindu ascetic) army fighting a British force. The book calls
        for the rise of Indian nationalism. The novel was also the source of
        the song Vande Mataram (I worship my Motherland for she truly is my
        mother) which, set to music by Rabindranath Tagore, was taken up by
        many Indian nationalists, and is now the National Song of India. The
        plot of the novel is loosely set on the Sannyasi Rebellion. He
        imagined untrained Sannyasi soldiers fighting and defeated the highly
        experienced British Army; ultimately, however, he accepted that the
        British could not be defeated.[10] The novel first appeared in serial
        form in Bangadarshan, the literary magazine that Chattopadhyay founded
        in 1872. Vande Mataram became prominent during the Swadeshi movement,
        which was sparked by Lord Curzon's attempt to partition Bengal into a
        Hindu majority West and Muslim majority East. Drawing from the Shakti
        tradition of Bengali Hindus, Chattopadhyay personified India as a
        Mother Goddess known as Bharat Mata, which gave the song a Hindu
        undertone. <br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bankim was
        particularly impressed by the historical Gaudiya Vaishnava cultural
        efflorescence of the 14th and 15th centuries in Bengal.
        Chattopadhyay's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita was published eight
        years after his death and contained his comments up to the 19th Verse
        of Chapter 4.[12] In a long essay on Sankhya philosophy, he argues
        that the central philosophical foundation of the overwhelming part of
        religious beliefs in India, including even Buddhism, lies in the
        philosophy of Sankhya. He was a critique of the philosophy in the
        sense of its emphasis on personal vairagya (renunciation) rather than
        political and social power. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bankim was highly
        educated and influenced by Oriental thoughts and ideas. Ramakrishna in
        contrast, did not have a formal education. Yet they had a nice
        relation between them. Once Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa, playing on
        the meaning of Bankim (Bent A Little), asked him what it was that had
        bent him. Bankim Chandra jokingly replied that it was the kick from
        the Englishman's shoe for he was a well-known critic of the British
        government. <br />
        Tagore penned in the memory of his mentor: <br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "Bankim Chandra had
        equal strength in both his hands, he was a true sabyasachi
        (ambidextrous). With one hand, he created literary works of
        excellence; and with the other, he guided young and aspiring authors.
        With one hand, he ignited the light of literary enlightenment ; and
        with the other, he blew away the smoke and ash of ignorance and ill
        conceived notions” <br />

        Sri Aurobindo wrote in his memory:
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "The earlier
        Bankim was only a poet and stylist, the later Bankim was a seer and
        nation-builder" <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
        After the Vishabriksha (The Poison Tree) was published in 1873, the
        magazine, Punch wrote: "You ought to read the Poison Tree of Bankim
        Chandra Chatterjee." <br />

      <h2>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar</h2>
      <img src="VD_Savarkar.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Vinayak Damodar "Veer" Savarkar (About this soundpronunciation
        (help·info); 28 May 1883 – 26 February 1966) was an Indian politician,
        activist, and writer. He developed the Hindu nationalist political
        ideology of Hindutva while imprisoned at Ratnagiri in 1922. He was a
        leading figure in the Indian independence movement[citation needed]
        and the Hindu Mahasabha.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Savarkar joined
        the Hindu Mahasabha and popularized the term Hindutva (Hinduness),
        previously coined by Chandranath Basu,to create a collective "Hindu"
        identity as an essence of Bharat (India). Savarkar was an atheist and
        also a pragmatic practitioner of Hindu philosophy.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Savarkar began
        his political activities as a high school student and continued to do
        so at Fergusson College in Pune.[9] He and his brother founded a
        secret society called Abhinav Bharat Society. When he went to the
        United Kingdom for his law studies, he involved himself with
        organizations such as India House and the Free India Society. He also
        published books advocating complete Indian independence by
        revolutionary means.[10] One of the books he published called The
        Indian War of Independence about the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was
        banned by the British colonial authorities. In 1910, Savarkar was
        arrested and ordered to be extradited to India for his connections
        with the revolutionary group India House.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On the voyage
        back to India, Savarkar staged an attempt to escape and seek asylum in
        France while the ship was docked in the port of Marseilles. The French
        port officials however handed him back to the British government in
        contravention of international law. On return to India, Savarkar was
        sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment totaling fifty years and
        was moved to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After 1937, he
        started traveling widely, becoming a forceful orator and writer,
        advocating Hindu political and social unity. Serving as the president
        of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar endorsed the idea of India as a Hindu
        Rashtra (Hindu Nation). He started his militarisation of Hindus from
        then in order to liberate the country and protect the country and
        Hindus in the future. Savarkar was critical of the decision taken by
        the Congress working committee in its Wardha session of 1942, passed a
        resolution which said to the British colonial government: "Quit India
        but keep your armies here" which was the reinstallation of the British
        military presence in India, which he felt would be much worse. In July
        1942, as he felt extremely stressed carrying out his duties as the
        president of Hindu Mahasabha, and as he needed some rest, he resigned
        from the post, the timing of which coincided with Gandhi's Quit India
        Movement. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In
        1948, Savarkar was charged as a co-conspirator in the assassination of
        Mahatma Gandhi; however, he was acquitted by the court for lack of
        evidence. Savarkar resurfaced in the popular discourse after the
        coming of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) into power in 1998 and
        again in 2014 with the Modi-led BJP government at the center.

      <h2>Bipin Chandra Pal</h2>
      <img src="Bipin-Chandra-Pal.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Bipin Chandra Pal (Bengali: বিপিন চন্দ্র পাল About this
        soundpronunciation (help·info); 7 November 1858 – 20 May 1932) was an
        Indian nationalist, writer, orator, social reformer and Indian
        independence movement freedom fighter. He was one third of the “Lal
        Bal Pal” triumvirate.[1] Pal was one of the main architects of the
        Swadeshi movement along with Sri Aurobindo. He also opposed the
        partition of Bengal by the British colonial government.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bipin Chandra
        Pal was born in the village of Poil, Habiganj, Sylhet District, Bengal
        Presidency of British India, in a Hindu Bengali Kayastha family.[2]
        His father was Ramchandra Pal, a Persian scholar, and small landowner.
        He studied and taught at the Church Mission Society College (now the
        St. Paul's Cathedral Mission College), an affiliated college of the
        University of Calcutta.[3] His son was Niranjan Pal, one of the
        founders of Bombay Talkies. His son-in-law was the ICS officer, S. K.
        Dey, who later became a union minister. His another son-in-law was
        freedom fighter Ullaskar Dutta who married Lila Dutta his childhood
        love interest after many circumstances at their last age.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As
        revolutionary as he was in politics, Pal was the same in his private
        life as well. After his first wife died, he married a widow and joined
        the Brahmo Samaj. <br />

        Pal featured on a 1958 Indian stamp.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pal is known as
        the Father of Revolutionary Thoughts in India and was one of the
        freedom fighters of India. Pal became a major leader of the Indian
        National Congress. At the Madras session of Indian National Congress
        held in 1887, Bipin Chandra Pal made a strong plea for repeal of the
        Arms Act which was discriminatory in nature. Along with Lala Lajpat
        Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak he belonged to the Lal-Bal-Pal trio that
        was associated with revolutionary activity. Sri Aurobindo Ghosh and
        Pal were recognised as the chief exponents of a new national movement
        revolving around the ideals of Purna Swaraj, Swadeshi, boycott and
        national education. His programme consisted of Swadeshi, boycott and
        national education. He preached and encouraged the use of Swadeshi and
        the boycott of foreign goods to eradicate poverty and unemployment. He
        wanted to remove social evils from the form and arouse the feelings of
        nationalism through national criticism. He had no faith in mild
        protests in the form of non-cooperation with the British colonial
        government. On that one issue, the assertive nationalist leader had
        nothing common with Mahatma Gandhi. During the last six years of his
        life, he parted company with the Congress and led a secluded life. Sri
        Aurobindo referred to him as one of mightiest prophets of nationalism.
        Bipin Chandra Pal made his efforts to remove social and economic ills.
        He opposed caste system and advocated widow remarriage. He advocated
        48 hours of work week and demanded for the hike in wages of workers.
        He expressed his disdain for Gandhi's ways, which he criticised for
        being rooted in “magic” instead of “logic”.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a
        journalist, Pal worked for Bengal Public Opinion, The Tribune and New
        India, where he propagated his brand of nationalism.[6] He wrote
        several articles warning India of the changes happening in China and
        other geopolitical situations. In one of his writings, describing
        where the future danger for India will come from, Pal wrote under the
        title "Our Real Danger". <br />

      <h2>Bal Gangadhar Tilak</h2>
      <img src="330px-Bal_Gangadhar_Tilak_crop.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Bal Gangadhar Tilak (or Lokmanya Tilak, About this soundpronunciation
        (help·info); 23 July 1856 – 1 August 1920), born as Keshav Gangadhar
        Tilak, was an Indian nationalist, teacher, and an independence
        activist. He was one third of the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate. Tilak was
        the first leader of the Indian independence movement. The British
        colonial authorities called him "The father of the Indian unrest." He
        was also conferred with the title of "Lokmanya", which means "accepted
        by the people (as their leader)". Mahatma Gandhi called him "The Maker
        of Modern India".
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak was one
        of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj ("self-rule") and a
        strong radical in Indian consciousness. He is known for his quote in
        Marathi: "Swarajya is my birthright and I shall have it!". He formed a
        close alliance with many Indian National Congress leaders including
        Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghose, V. O. Chidambaram
        Pillai and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Keshav
        Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in an Marathi Hindu Chitpavan
        Brahmin family in Ratnagiri, the headquarters of the Ratnagiri
        district of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay Presidency).[1] His
        ancestral village was Chikhali. His father, Gangadhar Tilak was a
        school teacher and a Sanskrit scholar who died when Tilak was sixteen.
        In 1871, Tilak was married to Tapibai (Née Bal) when he was sixteen, a
        few months before his father's death. After marriage, her name was
        changed to Satyabhamabai. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in first
        class in Mathematics from Deccan College of Pune in 1877. He left his
        M.A. course of study midway to join the L.L.B course instead, and in
        1879 he obtained his L.L.B degree from Government Law College.[6]
        After graduating, Tilak started teaching mathematics at a private
        school in Pune. Later, due to ideological differences with the
        colleagues in the new school, he withdrew and became a journalist.
        Tilak actively participated in public affairs. He stated: "Religion
        and practical life are not different. The real spirit is to make the
        country your family instead of working only for your own. The step
        beyond is to serve humanity and the next step is to serve God."
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Inspired by
        Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, he co-founded the New English school for
        secondary education in 1880 with a few of his college friends,
        including Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Mahadev Ballal Namjoshi and
        Vishnushastri Chiplunkar. Their goal was to improve the quality of
        education for India's youth. The success of the school led them to set
        up the Deccan Education Society in 1884 to create a new system of
        education that taught young Indians nationalist ideas through an
        emphasis on Indian culture.[8] The Society established the Fergusson
        College in 1885 for post-secondary studies. Tilak taught mathematics
        at Fergusson College. In 1890, Tilak left the Deccan Education Society
        for more openly political work.[9] He began a mass movement towards
        independence by an emphasis on a religious and cultural revival.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak had a
        long political career agitating for Indian autonomy from British
        colonial rule. Before Gandhi, he was the most widely known Indian
        political leader. Unlike his fellow Maharashtrian contemporary,
        Gokhale, Tilak was considered a radical Nationalist but a Social
        conservative. He was imprisoned on a number of occasions that included
        a long stint at Mandalay. At one stage in his political life he was
        called "the father of Indian unrest" by British author Sir Valentine
        Chirol. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak
        joined the Indian National Congress in 1890.[12] He opposed its
        moderate attitude, especially towards the fight for self-government.
        He was one of the most-eminent radicals at the time.[13] In fact, it
        was the Swadeshi movement of 1905–1907 that resulted in the split
        within the Indian National Congress into the Moderates and the
        Extremists. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
        During late 1896, a bubonic plague spread from Bombay to Pune, and by
        January 1897, it reached epidemic proportions. The British Indian Army
        was brought in to deal with the emergency and strict measures were
        employed to curb the plague, including the allowance of forced entry
        into private houses, the examination of the house's occupants,
        evacuation to hospitals and quarantine camps, removing and destroying
        personal possessions, and preventing patients from entering or leaving
        the city. By the end of May, the epidemic was under control. The
        measures used to curb the pandemic caused widespread resentment among
        the Indian public. Tilak took up this issue by publishing inflammatory
        articles in his paper Kesari (Kesari was written in Marathi, and
        "Maratha" was written in English), quoting the Hindu scripture, the
        Bhagavad Gita, to say that no blame could be attached to anyone who
        killed an oppressor without any thought of reward. Following this, on
        22 June 1897, Commissioner Rand and another British officer, Lt.
        Ayerst were shot and killed by the Chapekar brothers and their other
        associates. According to Barbara and Thomas R. Metcalf, Tilak "almost
        surely concealed the identities of the perpetrators".[14] Tilak was
        charged with incitement to murder and sentenced to 18 months
        imprisonment. When he emerged from prison in present-day Mumbai, he
        was revered as a martyr and a national hero. He adopted a new slogan
        coined by his associate Kaka Baptista: "Swaraj (self-rule) is my
        birthright and I shall have it."
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Following the
        Partition of Bengal, which was a strategy set out by Lord Curzon to
        weaken the nationalist movement, Tilak encouraged the Swadeshi
        movement and the Boycott movement.[17] The movement consisted of the
        boycott of foreign goods and also the social boycott of any Indian who
        used foreign goods. The Swadeshi movement consisted of the usage of
        natively produced goods. Once foreign goods were boycotted, there was
        a gap which had to be filled by the production of those goods in India
        itself. Tilak said that the Swadeshi and Boycott movements are two
        sides of the same coin.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Lala Lajpat Rai
        of Punjab, Bal Gangadhar Tilak (middle) of Maharashtra, and Bipin
        Chandra Pal of Bengal, the triumvirate were popularly known as Lal Bal
        Pal, changed the political discourse of the Indian independence
        movement. Tilak opposed the moderate views of Gopal Krishna Gokhale,
        and was supported by fellow Indian nationalists Bipin Chandra Pal in
        Bengal and Lala Lajpat Rai in Punjab. They were referred to as the
        "Lal-Bal-Pal triumvirate". In 1907, the annual session of the Congress
        Party was held at Surat, Gujarat. Trouble broke out over the selection
        of the new president of the Congress between the moderate and the
        radical sections of the party. The party split into the radicals
        faction, led by Tilak, Pal and Lajpat Rai, and the moderate faction.
        Nationalists like Aurobindo Ghose, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai were Tilak
        supporters. <br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When asked in
        Calcutta whether he envisioned a Maratha-type of government for
        independent India, Tilak answered that the Maratha-dominated
        governments of 17th and 18th centuries were outmoded in the 20th
        century, and he wanted a genuine federal system for Free India where
        everyone was an equal partner.[20] He added that only such a form of
        government would be able to safeguard India's freedom. He was the
        first Congress leader to suggest that Hindi written in the Devanagari
        script be accepted as the sole national language of India.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; During his
        lifetime among other political cases, Tilak had been tried for
        sedition charges in three times by British India Government—in
        1897,[22] 1909,[23] and 1916.[24] In 1897, Tilak was sentenced to 18
        months in prison for preaching disaffection against the Raj. In 1909,
        he was again charged with sedition and intensifying racial animosity
        between Indians and the British. The Bombay lawyer Muhammad Ali Jinnah
        appeared in Tilak's defence but he was sentenced to six years in
        prison in Burma in a controversial judgement.[25] In 1916 when for the
        third time Tilak was charged for sedition over his lectures on
        self-rule, Jinnah again was his lawyer and this time led him to
        acquittal in the case.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On 30 April
        1908, two Bengali youths, Prafulla Chaki and Khudiram Bose, threw a
        bomb on a carriage at Muzzafarpur, to kill the Chief Presidency
        Magistrate Douglas Kingsford of Calcutta fame, but erroneously killed
        two women traveling in it. While Chaki committed suicide when caught,
        Bose was hanged. Tilak, in his paper Kesari, defended the
        revolutionaries and called for immediate Swaraj or self-rule. The
        Government swiftly charged him with sedition. At the conclusion of the
        trial, a special jury convicted him by 7:2 majority. The judge,
        Dinshaw D. Davar gave him a six years jail sentence to be served in
        Mandalay, Burma and a fine of ₹1,000 (US$14). On being asked by the
        judge whether he had anything to say, Tilak said:
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All that I wish
        to say is that, in spite of the verdict of the jury, I still maintain
        that I am innocent. There are higher powers that rule the destinies of
        men and nations; and I think, it may be the will of Providence that
        the cause I represent may be benefited more by my suffering than by my
        pen and tongue. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
        Muhammad Ali Jinnah was his lawyer in the case.[27] Justice Davar's
        judgement came under stern criticism in press and was seen against
        impartiality of British justice system. Justice Davar himself
        previously had appeared for Tilak in his first sedition case in
        1897.[25] In passing sentence, the judge indulged in some scathing
        strictures against Tilak's conduct. He threw off the judicial
        restraint which, to some extent, was observable in his charge to the
        jury. He condemned the articles as "seething with sedition", as
        preaching violence, speaking of murders with approval. "You hail the
        advent of the bomb in India as if something had come to India for its
        good. I say, such journalism is a curse to the country". Tilak was
        sent to Mandalay from 1908 to 1914.[29] While imprisoned, he continued
        to read and write, further developing his ideas on the Indian
        nationalist movement. While in the prison he wrote the Gita
        Rahasya.[30] Many copies of which were sold, and the money was donated
        for the Indian Independence movement.

        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak developed
        diabetes during his sentence in Mandalay prison. This and the general
        ordeal of prison life had mellowed him at his release on 16 June 1914.
        When World War I started in August of that year, Tilak cabled the
        King-Emperor George V of his support and turned his oratory to find
        new recruits for war efforts. He welcomed The Indian Councils Act,
        popularly known as Minto-Morley Reforms, which had been passed by
        British Parliament in May 1909, terming it as "a marked increase of
        confidence between the Rulers and the Ruled". It was his conviction
        that acts of violence actually diminished, rather than hastening, the
        pace of political reforms. He was eager for reconciliation with
        Congress and had abandoned his demand for direct action and settled
        for agitations "strictly by constitutional means" – a line that had
        long been advocated by his rival Gokhale.[32][additional citation(s)
        needed] Tilak reunited with his fellow nationalists and rejoined the
        Indian National Congress during the Lucknow pact 1916.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak tried to
        convince Mohandas Gandhi to leave the idea of Total non-violence
        ("Total Ahimsa") and try to get self-rule ("Swarajya") by all
        means.[citation needed] Though Gandhi did not entirely concur with
        Tilak on the means to achieve self-rule and was steadfast in his
        advocacy of satyagraha, he appreciated Tilak's services to the country
        and his courage of conviction. After Tilak lost a civil suit against
        Valentine Chirol and incurred pecuniary loss, Gandhi even called upon
        Indians to contribute to the Tilak Purse Fund started with the
        objective of defraying the expenses incurred by Tilak. <br />

        Main article: All India Home Rule League
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak helped
        found the All India Home Rule League in 1916–18, with G. S. Khaparde
        and Annie Besant. After years of trying to reunite the moderate and
        radical factions, he gave up and focused on the Home Rule League,
        which sought self-rule. Tilak travelled from village to village for
        support from farmers and locals to join the movement towards
        self-rule.[29] Tilak was impressed by the Russian Revolution, and
        expressed his admiration for Vladimir Lenin.[35] The league had 1400
        members in April 1916, and by 1917 membership had grown to
        approximately 32,000. Tilak started his Home Rule League in
        Maharashtra, Central Provinces, and Karnataka and Berar region.
        Besant's League was active in the rest part of India.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak sought to
        unite the Indian population for mass political action throughout his
        life. For this to happen, he believed there needed to be a
        comprehensive justification for anti-British pro-Hindu activism. For
        this end, he sought justification in the supposed original principles
        of the Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita. He named this call to activism
        karma-yoga or the yoga of action.[37] In his interpretation, the
        Bhagavad Gita reveals this principle in the conversation between
        Krishna and Arjuna when Krishna exhorts Arjuna to fight his enemies
        (which in this case included many members of his family) because it is
        his duty. In Tilaks opinion, the Bhagavad Gita provided a strong
        justification of activism. However, this conflicted with the
        mainstream exegesis of the text at the time which was predominated by
        renunciate views and the idea of acts purely for God. This was
        represented by the two mainstream views at the time by Ramanuja and
        Adi Shankara. To find support for this philosophy, Tilak wrote his own
        interpretations of the relevant passages of the Gita and backed his
        views using Jnanadeva's commentary on the Gita, Ramanuja's critical
        commentary and his own translation of the Gita.[38] His main battle
        was against the renunciate views of the time which conflicted with
        worldly activism. To fight this, he went to extents to reinterpret
        words such as karma, dharma, yoga as well as the concept of
        renunciation itself. Because he found his rationalization on Hindu
        religious symbols and lines, he alienated many non-Hindus such as the
        Muslims who began to ally with the British for support.[citation
        needed] <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak
        was strongly opposed to liberal trends emerging in Pune such as
        women's rights and social reforms against untouchability.Tilak
        vehemently opposed the establishment of the first Native girls High
        school (now called Huzurpaga) in Pune in 1885 and its curriculum using
        his newspapers, the Mahratta and Kesari. Tilak was also opposed to
        intercaste marriage, particularly the match where an upper caste woman
        married a lower caste man.[43] In the case of Deshasthas, Chitpawans
        and Karhades, he encouraged these three Maharashtrian Brahmin groups
        to give up "caste exclusiveness" and intermarry.[a] Tilak officially
        opposed the age of consent bill which raised the age of marriage from
        ten to twelve for girls, however he was willing to sign a circular
        that increased age of marriage for girls to sixteen and twenty for
        boys. He fully supported social reforms but in his opinion self-rule
        took precedence over any social reform.[45][46] On the whole Tilak was
        not against social reforms. Though he was against the age of consent
        bill, he arranged his daughter's marriage at the age of fifteen. He
        also advocated widow marriages. He also congratulated Dhondo Keshav
        Karve when he married a widow after the death of their first wife. He
        was in the favour of social reforms but without the interference of
        British Government.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Child bride
        Rukhmabai was married at the age of eleven but refused to go and live
        with her husband. The husband sued for restitution of conjugal rights,
        initially lost but appealed the decision. On 4 March 1887, Justice
        Farran, using interpretations of Hindu laws, ordered Rukhmabai to "go
        live with her husband or face six months of imprisonment". Tilak
        approved of this decision of the court and said that the court was
        following Hindu Dharmaśāstras. Rukhmabai responded that she would
        rather face imprisonment than obey the verdict. Her marriage was later
        dissolved by Queen Victoria. Later, she went on to receive her Doctor
        of Medicine degree from the London School of Medicine for Women.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 1890, when
        an eleven-year-old Phulamani Bai died while having sexual intercourse
        with her much older husband, the Parsi social reformer Behramji
        Malabari supported the Age of Consent Act, 1891 to raise the age of a
        girl's eligibility for marriage. Tilak opposed the Bill and said that
        the Parsis as well as the English had no jurisdiction over the (Hindu)
        religious matters. He blamed the girl for having "defective female
        organs" and questioned how the husband could be "persecuted
        diabolically for doing a harmless act". He called the girl one of
        those "dangerous freaks of nature".[41] Tilak did not have a
        progressive view when it came to gender relations. He did not believe
        that Hindu women should get a modern education. Rather, he had a more
        conservative view, believing that women were meant to be homemakers
        who had to subordinate themselves to the needs of their husbands and
        children. Tilak refused to sign a petition for the abolition of
        untouchability in 1918, two years before his death, although he had
        spoken against it earlier in a meeting.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak and Swami
        Vivekananda had great mutual respect and esteem for each other. They
        met accidentally while travelling by train in 1892 and Tilak had
        Vivekananda as a guest in his house. A person who was present
        there(Basukaka), heard that it was agreed between Vivekananda and
        Tilak that Tilak would work towards nationalism in the "political"
        arena, while Vivekananda would work for nationalism in the "religious"
        arena. When Vivekananda died at a young age, Tilak expressed great
        sorrow and paid tributes to him in the Kesari.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "No Hindu, who,
        has the interests of Hinduism at his heart, could help feeling grieved
        over Vivekananda's samadhi. Vivekananda, in short, had taken the work
        of keeping the banner of Advaita philosophy forever flying among all
        the nations of the world and made them realize the true greatness of
        Hindu religion and of the Hindu people. He had hoped that he would
        crown his achievement with the fulfillment of this task by virtue of
        his learning, eloquence, enthusiasm and sincerity, just as he had laid
        a secure foundation for it; but with Swami's samadhi, these hopes have
        gone. Thousands of years ago, another saint, Shankaracharya, who,
        showed to the world the glory and greatness of Hinduism. At the fag of
        the 19th century, the second Shankaracharya is Vivekananda, who,
        showed to the world the glory of Hinduism. His work has yet to be
        completed. We have lost our glory, our independence, everything."
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Shahu, the
        ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur, had several conflicts with
        Tilak as the latter agreed with the Brahmins decision of Puranic
        rituals for the Marathas that were intended for Shudras. Tilak even
        suggested that the Marathas should be "content" with the Shudra status
        assigned to them by the Brahmins. Tilak's newspapers, as well as the
        press in Kolhapur, criticized Shahu for his caste prejudice and his
        unreasoned hostility towards Brahmins. These included serious
        allegations such as sexual assaults by Shahu against four Brahmin
        women. An English woman named Lady Minto was petitioned to help them.
        The agent of Shahu had blamed these allegations on the "troublesome
        brahmins". Tilak and another Brahmin suffered from the confiscation of
        estates by Shahu, the first during a quarrel between Shahu and the
        Shankaracharya of Sankareshwar and later in another issue.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tilak started
        two weeklies, Kesari ("The Lion") in Marathi and Mahratta in English
        (sometimes referred as 'Maratha' in Academic Study Books) in 1880–1881
        with Gopal Ganesh Agarkar as the first editor.[58] By this he was
        recognized as 'awakener of India', as Kesari later became a daily and
        continues publication to this day.[citation needed] In 1894, Tilak
        transformed the household worshipping of Ganesha into a grand public
        event (Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav). The celebrations consisted of several
        days of processions, music, and food. They were organized by the means
        of subscriptions by neighbourhood, caste, or occupation. Students
        often would celebrate Hindu and national glory and address political
        issues; including patronage of Swadeshi goods.[59] In 1895, Tilak
        founded the Shri Shivaji Fund Committee for the celebration of "Shiv
        Jayanti", the birth anniversary of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha
        Empire. The project also had the objective of funding the
        reconstruction of the tomb (Samadhi) of Shivaji at Raigad Fort. For
        this second objective, Tilak established the Shri Shivaji Raigad
        Smarak Mandal along with Senapati Khanderao Dabhade II of Talegaon
        Dabhade, who became the founder President of the Mandal.[citation
        needed] <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The
        events like the Ganapati festival and Shiv Jayanti were used by Tilak
        to build a national spirit beyond the circle of the educated elite in
        opposition to colonial rule. But it also exacerbated Hindu-Muslim
        differences. The festival organizers would urge Hindus to protect cows
        and boycott the Muharram celebrations organized by Shi'a Muslims, in
        which Hindus had formerly often participated. Thus, although the
        celebrations were meant to be a way to oppose colonial rule, they also
        contributed to religious tensions.[59] Contemporary Marathi Hindu
        nationalist parties like the Shiv Sena took up his reverence for
        Shivaji.[60] However, Indian Historian, Uma Chakravarti cites
        Professor Gordon Johnson and states "It is significant that even at
        the time when Tilak was making political use of Shivaji the question
        of conceding Kshatriya status to him as Maratha was resisted by the
        conservative Brahmins including Tilak. While Shivaji was a Brave man,
        all his bravery, it was argued, did not give him the right to a status
        that very nearly approached that of a Brahmin. Further, the fact that
        Shivaji worshiped the Brahmanas in no way altered social relations,
        'since it was as a Shudra he did it – as a Shudra the servant, if not
        the slave, of the Brahmin'".
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Deccan
        Education Society that Tilak founded with others in the 1880s still
        runs Institutions in Pune like the Fergusson College.[citation needed]
        The Swadeshi movement started by Tilak at the beginning of the 20th
        century became part of the Independence movement until that goal was
        achieved in 1947. One can even say Swadeshi remained part of Indian
        Government policy until the 1990s when the Congress Government
        liberalised the economy.[62][better source needed] Tilak said, "I
        regard India as my Motherland and my Goddess, the people in India are
        my kith and kin, and loyal and steadfast work for their political and
        social emancipation is my highest religion and duty".
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 1903, Tilak
        wrote the book "The Arctic Home in the Vedas". In it, he argued that
        the Vedas could only have been composed in the Arctics, and the Aryan
        bards brought them south after the onset of the last ice age. He
        proposed a new way to determine the exact time of the Vedas.[citation
        needed] In "The Orion", he tried to calculate the time of the Vedas by
        using the position of different Nakshatras.[64] The positions of the
        Nakshtras were described in different Vedas. Tilak wrote "Shrimadh

      <h2>Lala Lajpat Rai</h2>
      <img src="Lala_lajpat_Rai.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Lala Lajpat Rai (28 January 1865 — 17 November 1928) was an Indian
        independence activist. He played a pivotal role in the Indian
        Independence movement. He was popularly known as Punjab Kesari. He was
        one of the three Lal Bal Pal triumvirates. He was also associated with
        activities of Punjab National Bank and Lakshmi Insurance Company in
        their early stages of death in 1894. He died a few weeks after
        sustaining severe injuries during a baton charge by police when he led
        a peaceful protest march against the all-British Simon Commission, a
        commission constituted by the United Kingdom for Indian constitutional
        reform. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Rai was
        born on 28 January 1865 in an Agrawal Jain family, as a son of Urdu
        and Persian government school teacher Munshi Radha Krishan and his
        wife Gulab Devi at Dhudike in Ludhiana district of Punjab Province. He
        spent much of his youth in Jagraon. His house still stands tall in
        Jagraon and houses a library and museum.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the late
        1870s, his father was transferred to Rewari, where he had his initial
        education in Government Higher Secondary School, Rewari, Punjab
        province, where his father was posted as an Urdu teacher. During his
        early life, Rai's liberal views and belief in Hinduism were shaped by
        his father and deeply religious mother respectively, which he
        successfully applied to create a career of reforming the religion and
        Indian policy through politics and journalistic writing. In 1880,
        Lajpat Rai joined Government College at Lahore to study law, where he
        came in contact with patriots and future freedom fighters, such as
        Lala Hans Raj and Pandit Guru Dutt. While studying at Lahore he was
        influenced by the Hindu reformist movement of Swami Dayanand
        Saraswati, became a member of existing Arya Samaj Lahore (founded
        1877) and founder-editor of Lahore-based Arya Gazette. When studying
        law, he became a firm believer in the idea that Hinduism, above
        nationality, was the pivotal point upon which an Indian lifestyle must
        be based. He believed Hinduism led to practices of peace and humanity,
        and that when nationalist ideas were added to this peaceful belief
        system, a secular nation could be formed. This focus on Hindu
        practices in the subcontinent would ultimately lead him to the
        continuation of peaceful movements to create successful demonstrations
        for Indian independence.[better source needed] Though his increasing
        proximity with non-secular organisations such as the Hindu Mahasabha
        leaders gathered criticism from the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, Rai was
        otherwise venerated by the members of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Lala Lajpat Rai
        (left) of Punjab, Bal Gangadhar Tilak of Maharashtra, and Bipin
        Chandra Pal of Bengal, the triumvirate were popularly known as Lal Bal
        Pal, changed the political discourse of the Indian independence
        movement. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In
        1884, his father was transferred to Rohtak and Rai came along after
        the completion of his studies at Lahore. In 1886, he moved to Hisar
        where his father was transferred, and started to practice law and
        became a founding member of the Bar council of Hisar along with Babu
        Churamani. In the same year he also founded the Hisar district branch
        of the Indian National Congress and reformist Arya Samaj with Babu
        Churamani (lawyer), three Tayal brothers (Chandu Lal Tayal, Hari Lal
        Tayal and Balmokand Tayal), Dr. Ramji Lal Hooda, Dr. Dhani Ram, Arya
        Samaj Pandit Murari Lal, Seth Chhaju Ram Jat (founder of Jat School,
        Hisar) and Dev Raj Sandhir. In 1888 and again in 1889, he had the
        honor of being one of the four delegates from Hisar to attend the
        annual session of the Congress at Allahabad, along with Babu
        Churamani, Lala Chhabil Das and Seth Gauri Shankar. In 1892, he moved
        to Lahore to practice before the Lahore High Court. To shape the
        political policy of India to gain independence, he also practiced
        journalism and was a regular contributor to several newspapers
        including The Tribune. In 1886, he helped Mahatma Hansraj establish
        the nationalistic Dayananda Anglo-Vedic School, Lahore
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 1914, he
        quit law practice to dedicate himself to the Indian independence
        movement and travelled to Britain, and then to the United States in
        1917. In October 1917, he founded the Indian Home Rule League of
        America in New York. He stayed in the United States from 1917 to 1920.
        His early freedom struggle was impacted by Arya Samaj and communal
        representation. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
        After joining the Indian National Congress and taking part in
        political agitation in Punjab, Lala Lajpat Rai was deported to
        Mandalay, but there was insufficient evidence to hold him for
        subversion. Lajpat Rai's supporters attempted to secure his election
        to the presidency of the party session at Surat in December 1907, but
        he did not succeed.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Graduates of
        the National College, which he founded inside the Bradlaugh Hall at
        Lahore as an alternative to British-style institutions, included
        Bhagat Singh.[15] He was elected President of the Indian National
        Congress in the Calcutta Special Session of 1920.[16] In 1921, he
        founded Servants of the People Society, a non-profit welfare
        organisation, in Lahore, which shifted its base to Delhi after
        partition, and has branches in many parts of India. According to him,
        Hindu society needs to fight its own battle with caste system,
        position of women and untouchability. Vedas were an important part of
        Hindu religion but the lower caste were not allowed to read them. Lala
        Lajpat Rai approved that the lower caste should be allowed to read
        them and recite the mantras. He believed that everyone should be
        allowed to read and learn from the Vedas.

        in honour of Lala Lajpat Rai by the California Chapter of the
        Hindustan Association of America at Hotel Shattuck in Berkeley on 12
        February 1916. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
        Lajpat Rai travelled to the United States in 1917, and then returned
        during World War I. He toured Sikh communities along the Western
        Seaboard, visited the Tuskegee University in Alabama, and met with
        workers in the Philippines. His travelogue, The United States of
        America (1916), details these travels and features extensive
        quotations from leading African American intellectuals, including
        W.E.B. Du Bois and Fredrick Douglass. While in the United States he
        had founded the Indian Home Rule League in New York City and a monthly
        journal, the Young India and Hindustan Information Services
        Association. Rai petitioned the United States House Committee on
        Foreign Affairs, painting a vivid picture of maladministration by the
        British Raj in India, the aspirations of Indian public for
        independence amongst many other points which strongly sought the
        support of the international community for the attainment of Indian
        independence. The 32-page petition, which was prepared overnight, was
        discussed in the U.S. Senate in October 1917. The book also argues for
        the notion of "color-caste," suggesting sociological similarities
        between race in the US and caste in India. During World War I, Lajpat
        Rai lived in the United States, but he returned to India in 1919 and
        in the following year led the special session of the Congress Party
        that launched the non-co-operation movement. He was imprisoned from
        1921 to 1923 and elected to the legislative assembly on his release.

        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In 1928, the
        United Kingdom set up the Simon Commission, headed by Sir John Simon
        (later, Lord Simon, 1st Viscount Simon) to report on the political
        situation in India. The Commission was boycotted by Indian political
        parties because it did not include any Indian members, and it was met
        with country-wide protests. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30
        October 1928, Lajpat Rai led a non-violent march in protest against
        it. The protesters chanted "Simon Go Back" and carried black flags.
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The police
        superintendent in Lahore, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi
        charge the protesters and personally assaulted Rai. Despite being
        severely injured, Rai subsequently addressed the crowd and said "I
        declare that the blows struck at me today will be the last nails in
        the coffin of British rule in India".
        <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; He did not
        fully recover from his injuries and died on 17 November 1928. Doctors
        thought that Scott's blows had hastened his death. However, when the
        matter was raised in the British Parliament, the British government
        denied any role in Rai's death. Bhagat Singh, an HSRA revolutionary
        who was a witness to the event, swore to avenge the death of Rai, who
        was a significant leader of the Indian independence movement. He
        joined other revolutionaries, Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and
        Chandrashekhar Azad, in a plot to kill Scott to send a message to the
        British government. However, in a case of mistaken identity, Bhagat
        Singh was signalled to shoot on the appearance of John P. Saunders, an
        assistant superintendent of the Lahore police. He was shot by Rajguru
        and Bhagat Singh while leaving the District Police Headquarters in
        Lahore on 17 December 1928.Chanan Singh, a Head Constable who was
        chasing them, was fatally injured by Azad's covering fire. <br />

      <h2>Bhagat Singh</h2>
      <hr />
      <img src="Bhagat_singh_1929.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Bhagat Singh (Punjabi pronunciation: [pə̀ɡət̪ sɪ́ŋɡ] (About this
        soundlisten) 1907[a] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian socialist
        revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British
        in India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian
        independence movement. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In December 1928,
        Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a
        21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab,
        in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on
        probation, for the British police superintendent, James Scott, whom
        they had intended to assassinate.[5] They believed Scott was
        responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala
        Lajpat Rai by having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured
        and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a
        police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired
        from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he
        was then shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem
        report showing eight bullet wounds Another associate of Singh, Chandra
        Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan
        Singh, who attempted to give chase to Singh and Rajguru as they fled.
        <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After having escaped,
        Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging
        Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that they altered to
        show Saunders as their intended target. Singh was thereafter on the
        run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time.
        Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar
        Dutt, set off two home-made bombs inside the Central Legislative
        Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the gallery on the
        legislators below, shouted slogans, and then allowed the authorities
        to arrest them.[8] The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to
        light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting trial,
        Singh gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant
        Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for
        Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's death from starvation in
        September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged in March 1931, aged 23.
        <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bhagat Singh became a
        popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him:
        "Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism
        but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala
        Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act
        was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town
        and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of
        northern India, resounded with his name." In still later years, Singh,
        an atheist and socialist in life, won admirers in India from among a
        political spectrum that included both communists and right-wing Hindu
        nationalists. Although many of Singh's associates, as well as many
        Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in daring
        acts and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be
        lionised in popular art and literature to the same extent as Singh.

      <h2>Chandrasekhar Azad</h2>
      <img src="Chandrasekhar_azad.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Chandrasekhar Azad was born as on 23 July 1906 in Bhabhra village as
        Chandra Shekhar Tiwari, in the princely-state of Alirajpur. His
        forefathers were from Badarka village of Unnao District. His mother,
        Jagrani Devi, was the third wife of Sitaram Tiwari, whose previous
        wives had died young. After the birth of their first son, Sukhdev, in
        Badarka, the family moved to Alirajpur State. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; His mother wanted her
        son to be a great Sanskrit scholar and persuaded his father to send
        him to Kashi Vidyapeeth, Banaras, to study. In 1921, when the
        Non-Cooperation Movement was at its height, Chandra Shekhar, then a
        15-year-old student, joined. As a result, he was arrested on 20
        December. On being presented before the district magistrate Justice
        Reverend Tomson Kregat a week later, he gave his name as "Azad" (The
        Free), his father's name as "Swatantrata" (Independence) and his
        residence as "Jail". The angered magistrate ordered him to detained to
        jail for 23 weeks and ordered be punished with 15 lashes a day. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After the suspension
        of the non-cooperation movement in 1922 by Gandhi, Azad was
        disappointed. He met a young revolutionary, Manmath Nath Gupta, who
        introduced him to Ram Prasad Bismil who had formed the Hindustan
        Republican Association (HRA), a revolutionary organisation. He then
        became an active member of the HRA and started to collect funds for
        HRA. Most of the fund collection was through robberies of government
        property. He was involved in the Kakori Train Robbery of 1925, the
        shooting of J. P. Saunders at Lahore in 1928 to avenge the killing of
        Lala Lajpat Rai, and at last, in the attempt to blow up the Viceroy of
        India's train in 1929. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Azad made Jhansi his
        organisation's hub for some time. He used the forest of Orchha,
        situated 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Jhansi, as a site for shooting
        practice and, being an expert marksman, he trained other members of
        his group. He built a hut near to a Hanuman temple on the banks of the
        Satar River and lived there under the alias of Pandit Harishankar
        Bramhachari for a long period. He taught children from the nearby
        village of Dhimarpura and thus managed to establish good rapport with
        the local residents. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While living in
        Jhansi, he also learned to drive a car at the Bundelkhand Motor Garage
        in Sadar Bazar. Sadashivrao Malkapurkar, Vishwanath Vaishampayan and
        Bhagwan Das Mahaur came in close contact with him and became an
        integral part of his revolutionary group. The then congress leaders,
        Raghunath Vinayak Dhulekar and Sitaram Bhaskar Bhagwat were also close
        to Azad. He also stayed for sometime in the house of Rudra Narayan
        Singh at Nai Basti, as well as Bhagwat's house in Nagra. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of his main
        supporters was Bundelkhand Kesri Dewan Shatrughan Singh, the founder
        of the freedom movement in Bundelkhand, he gave Azad financial as well
        as assistance with weapons and fighters. Azad visited his fort
        multiple times in Mangrauth. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Hindustan
        Republican Association (HRA) was formed by Bismil, Jogesh Chandra
        Chatterjee, Sachindra Nath Sanyal and Shachindra Nath Bakshi in 1923.
        In the aftermath of the Kakori train robbery in 1925, the British
        clamped down on revolutionary activities. Prasad, Ashfaqulla Khan,
        Thakur Roshan Singh and Rajendra Nath Lahiri were sentenced to death
        for their participation. Azad, Keshab Chakravarthy and Murari Sharma
        evaded capture. Chandra Shekhar Azad later reorganised the HRA with
        the help of revolutionaries like Shiv Verma and Mahavir Singh. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Azad, Bhagat Singh
        along with other revolutionaries secretly reorganised the Hindustan
        Republican Association (HRA) as the Hindustan Socialist Republican
        Association (HSRA) on 9 September 1928.[9] so as to achieve their
        primary aim of an independent India based on socialist principle. The
        insight of his revolutionary activities are described by Manmath Nath
        Gupta, a fellow member of HSRA in his numerous writings. Gupta has
        also written his biography titled "Chandrashekhar Azad" and in his
        book History of the Indian Revolutionary Movement (English version of
        above: 1972) he gave a deep insight about Azad's activities, his
        ideologies and the HSRA. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; On 27 February 1931,
        the CID head of the police at Allahabad, Sir J. R. H. Nott-Bower was
        tipped off by someone that Azad was at Alfred Park and was having a
        talk with his companion Sukhdev Raj. On receiving it, Bower called on
        the Allahabad police to accompany him to the park to arrest him.
        Azad's old comrades Veerbhadra Tiwari and Yashpal were also held
        responsible for tipping off two of the police constables. The police
        arrived at the park and surrounded it from all four sides. Some
        constables along with DSP Thakur Vishweshwar Singh entered the park
        armed with rifles and the shootout began. Sukhdev Raj escaped
        uninjured. Azad hid behind a tree to save himself and began to fire
        from behind it. The police fired back. After a long shootout, holding
        true to his pledge to always remain Azad (Free) and never be captured
        alive, he shot himself with his last bullet. In the shootout, Bower
        and DSP Singh were injured in the right palm and jaws respectively.
        The police recovered Azad's body after the other officers arrived at
        the site. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The body was sent to
        Rasulabad Ghat for cremation without informing the general public. As
        it came to light, people surrounded the park where the incident had
        taken place. They chanted slogans against British rule and praised
        Azad. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Several schools,
        colleges, roads, and other public institutions across India are also
        named after him. Starting from Jagdish Gautam's 1963 film
        Chandrasekhar Azad and Manoj Kumar's 1965 film Shaheed, many films
        have featured the character of Azad. Manmohan played Azad in the 1965
        film, Sunny Deol portrayed Azad in the movie 23rd March 1931: Shaheed,
        Azad was portrayed by Akhilendra Mishra in The Legend of Bhagat Singh
        and Raj Zutshi portrayed Azad in Shaheed-E-Azam. In the 2006 film,
        Rang De Basanti, produced and directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra,
        Azad was portrayed by Aamir Khan. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jawaharlal Nehru
        however in his autobiography writes that Azad met him a few weeks
        before his death, inquiring about possibility of not being considered
        an outlaw as a result of Gandhi-Irwin pact. He also saw the 'futility'
        of his methods and so did many of his associates, though not
        completely convinced of the 'peaceful methods'. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The lives of Azad,
        Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Bismil, and Ashfaq were depicted in the 2006
        film Rang De Basanti, with Aamir Khan portraying Azad. The movie,
        which draws parallels between the lives of young revolutionaries such
        as Azad and Bhagat Singh, and today's youth, also dwells upon the lack
        of appreciation among today's Indian youth for the sacrifices made by
        these men. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The 2018 television
        series Chandrashekhar chronicles the life of Chandra Shekhar Azad from
        his childhood to the legendary revolutionary leader. In the series
        young Chandrashekar Azad was portrayed by Ayaan Zubair, Azad in his
        teens by Dev Joshi and Adult Azad by Karan Sharma. <br />

      <h2>Rash Behari Bose</h2>
      <img src="Rash_Behari_Bose.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        Rash Behari Bose (About this soundpronunciation (help·info); Bengali: রাসবিহারী বসু Rashbihari Boshu; 25 May
        1886 – 21 January 1945) was an Indian revolutionary leader against the British Raj. He was born in Village
        Subaldaha, Purba Bardhaman district of West Bengal. He was one of the key organisers of the Ghadar Mutiny, and
        later the Indian National Army. Rash Behari Bose handed over Indian National Army to Subhas Chandra Bose. <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


        Rash Behari Bose was born on 25 May 1886 in a Bengali Kayastha family. There is no controversy regarding the
        place of his birth. He was born in his native village named Subaldaha situated in Purba Bardhaman district, West
        Bengal, India. His father's name was Binod Behari Bose. Bhubaneswari Devi was his mother. Tinkori Dasi was
        Rashbehari Bose's foster mother. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


        The major part of the childhood of Rashbehari Bose and Sushila Sarkar (his sister) was spent in the village
        Subaldaha. They lived in this village at the house of madam Bidhumukhi and his paternal house. Bidhumukhi was a
        widow from her early life. Bidhumukhi was the sister in law of Kalicharan Bose. His early education was
        completed under the supervision of his grandfather, Kalicharan Bose, at village Pathsala (Presently "Subaldaha
        Rashbehari Bose F.P School"). Rash Behari Bose got an education of Lathi Khela in his child at Subaldaha. He got
        the inspiration of revolutionary movement hearing stories from his grandfather and teacher (Bakkeswar) at his
        birthplace Subaldaha. He was the cynosure of all villagers. His nickname was Rasu. He was stubborn and the
        villagers loved him very much. It is heard from villagers that he was at Subaldaha till he was 12 or 14 years
        old. His father, Binod Behari Bose, was stationed in Hooghly district for few years. Bose studied at Dupleix
        College with his friend Shrish Chandra Ghosh. The principal Charu Chandra Roy inspired them into revolutionary
        politics. Later he joined "Morton school" in Kolkata. Bose later earned degrees in the medical sciences as well
        as in Engineering from France and Germany. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


        He was interested in revolutionary activities from early on in his life, he left Bengal to shun the Alipore bomb
        case trials of (1908). At Dehradun he worked as a head clerk at the Forest Research Institute. There, through
        Amarendra Chatterjee of the Jugantar led by Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin), he secretly got involved with the
        revolutionaries of Bengal and he came across eminent revolutionary members of the Arya Samaj in the United
        Provinces (currently Uttar Pradesh) and the Punjab. Originally Rash Behari Bose stay few years in Hooghly
        district, West Bengal. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



        Following the attempt to assassinate Lord Hardinge, Rash Behari was forced to go into hiding. The attempt was
        made on 23 December 1912 in Delhi when Lord Hardinge was in a ceremonial procession transferring the capital
        from Calcutta to New Delhi. He was attacked near the Red Fort by Basanta Kumar Biswas a disciple of Amrendar
        Chatterjee, but missed the target and failed. The bomb was made by Manindra Nath Nayak. Bose was hunted by the
        colonial police due to his active participation in the failed assassination attempt directed at the Governor
        General and Viceroy Lord Charles Hardinge in Delhi. He returned to Dehra Dun by the night train and joined the
        office the next day as though nothing had happened. Further, he organized a meeting of loyal citizens of
        Dehradun to condemn the dastardly attack on the Viceroy. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

        Lord Hardinge, in his My Indian Years, described the whole incident in an interesting way. During the flood
        relief work in Bengal in 1913, he came in contact with Jatin Mukherjee in whom he "discovered a real leader of
        men," who "added a new impulse" to Rash Behari's failing zeal. Thus during World War I he became extensively
        involved as one of the leading figures of the Gadar Revolution that attempted to trigger a mutiny in India in
        February 1915. Trusted and tried Ghadrites were sent to several cantonments to infiltrate into the army. The
        idea of the Gadar leaders was that with the war raging in Europe most of the soldiers had gone out of India and
        the rest could be easily won over. The revolution failed and most of the revolutionaries were arrested. But Rash
        Behari managed to escape British intelligence and reached Japan in 1915. <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160

        Bose fled to Japan in 1915, under the alias of Priyanath Thakur, a relative of Rabindranath Thakur. There, Bose
        found shelter with various Pan-Asian groups. From 1915–1918, he changed residences and identities numerous
        times, as the British kept pressing the Japanese government for his extradition. He married the daughter of Aizō
        Sōma and Kokkō Sōma, the owners of Nakamuraya bakery in Tokyo and noted Pan-Asian supporters in 1918, and became
        a Japanese citizen in 1923, living as a journalist and writer. It is also significant that he was instrumental
        in introducing Indian-style curry in Japan. Though more expensive than the usual "British-style" curry, it
        became quite popular, with Rash Bihari becoming known as "Bose of Nakamuraya". <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

        Bose along with A M Nair was instrumental in persuading the Japanese authorities to stand by the Indian patriots
        and ultimately to officially actively support the Indian independence struggle abroad. Bose convened a
        conference in Tokyo on 28–30 March 1942, which decided to establish the Indian Independence League. At the
        conference, he moved a motion to raise an army for Indian independence. He convened the second conference of the
        League at Bangkok on 22 June 1942. It was at this conference that a resolution was adopted to invite Subhas
        Chandra Bose to join the League and take its command as its president. <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

        The Indian prisoners of war captured by the Japanese in the Malaya and Burma fronts were encouraged to join the
        Indian Independence League and become the soldiers of the Indian National Army (INA), formed on 1 September 1942
        as the military wing of Rash Behari Bose's Indian National League. He selected the flag for the Azad Hind
        movement and handed over the flag to Subhas Chandra Bose. But although he handed over the power, his
        organizational structure remained, and it was on the organizational spadework of Rash Behari Bose. Rash Behari
        Bose built the Indian National Army (also called 'Azad Hind Fauj'). Prior to his death caused by tuberculosis,
        the Japanese Government honoured him with the Order of the Rising Sun (2nd grade). <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


        Bose met Toshiko Soma when he was hiding at her house in Shinjuku City. She was the daughter of Aizō Sōma and
        Kokkō Sōma, the owners of Nakamuraya bakery (ja:中村屋) in Tokyo and noted Pan-Asian supporters in 1918. At that
        time, Bose was a fugitive with the British searching for him. Their initial contact was during those intense
        moments of hiding though without any interactions. In 1916, when Bose was a fugitive no more, he invited the
        Soma family to his house as a gesture of gratitude. That was the first instance of their interaction in a social
        context. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

        However, Bose stuck out like a sore thumb in Japan. People would consider them with suspicion. Mitsuru Toyama,
        as a solution proposed to the Soma's a marriage between Toshiko and Rashbehari. He thought that marriage with a
        Japanese citizen would make it easy for Bose to apply for citizenship. Despite their initial reservations, the
        Soma's agreed to the match. When they asked for Toshiko's consent, she took three weeks to decide. <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

        They had a happy marriage that lasted for eight years. Bose taught Toshiko Bengali and how to wear a sari. Bose
        got Japanese citizenship in 1923. Toshiko's health declined soon after and it claimed her life in 1924. After
        her death, he never remarried. They were buried together after Bose's death. <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

        They had two children together. Masahide Bose (Bharatchandra) was born in 1920. He died in World War II aged 24.
        Their daughter Tetsuko was born in 1922. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


        A dinner party given to Bose in his honour by his close Japanese friends, including Mitsuru Tōyama, a right-wing
        nationalist and Pan-Asianism leader (centre, behind the table), and Tsuyoshi Inukai, future Japanese prime
        minister (to the right of Tōyama). Behind Tōyama is Bose. 1915. <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


        In an Indian Bengali Serial titled 'Netaji' played in 2019, that portrayed the life of Netaji Subhash Chandra
        Bose, Bengali actor Fahim Mirza was seen to have played the role of Rash Behari Bose. <br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


        In the year of 1943, the Japanese government honoured him with the highest title given to a foreigner – The
        Second Order of Merit of the Rising Sun. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

      <h2>Subhas Chandra Bose</h2>
      <hr />
      <img src="Subhas_Chandra_Bose_NRB.jpg" alt="Subhas_Chandra_Bose_NRB" />
      <p>
        Subhas Chandra Bose 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian
        nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India, but
        whose attempts during World War II to rid India of British rule with
        the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a troubled legacy.
        The honorific Netaji (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first
        applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the
        Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special
        Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Subhas Bose was born
        into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during
        the high noon of the British Raj. The early recipient of an unusually
        Anglocentric education, his teenage and young adult years were
        interspersed with brilliant academic success, oversize religious
        yearning, and stark rebellion against authority. In a college in which
        his five brothers had preceded him, he was expelled for participating
        in an assault on a professor. He was also rusticated from the
        University of Calcutta, but after reinstatement 18 months later he
        managed to study blamelessly and excel academically. Sent to England
        at his father's urging to take the Indian Civil Service examination,
        he succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at
        taking the more routine but clinching final exam. He cited nationalism
        to be a higher calling than the civil service. Returning to India in
        1921 to join the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the
        Indian National Congress, Bose at first worked with C. R. Das in
        Bengal. He flowered under Das's mentorship. He then followed
        Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress. The
        group was younger, less keen on constitutional reform, and more open
        to socialism. Bose rose precociously to become Congress president in
        1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between Bose and
        Gandhi. The senior leadership in the Congress supported Gandhi, and
        Bose resigned as president, and was eventually ousted from the party.
        In July 1940, Bose was arrested by the Bengal government over a small
        protest, and later kept housebound under a strict police watch. In
        mid-January 1941, he escaped from India in dramatic cloak-and-dagger
        fashion, heading northwestward into Afghanistan.
        <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In April 1941, Bose
        arrived in Nazi Germany, where the leadership offered unexpected, if
        equivocal, sympathy for India's independence. In November 1941, German
        funds were used to open a Free India Centre in Berlin, and to set up a
        Free India Radio on which Bose broadcast nightly. A 3,000-strong Free
        India Legion was recruited from among Indian POWs captured by Erwin
        Rommel's Afrika Korps to serve under Bose. Bose's reputation as a
        politician, adversely affected in the previous two years, was
        refurbished somewhat.Throughout 1941 the Germans intermittently but
        inconclusively considered a land invasion of India. Although it was
        peripheral to their main goals in Eastern Europe, Bose remained
        optimistic about its likelihood. By the spring of 1942, however, the
        German army had become mired in Russia, and Japan had won quick
        victories in Asia. A German land invasion of India became untenable,
        and Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia. Adolf Hitler, during
        his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942, suggested the same and
        offered to arrange a submarine. During this time Bose became a father;
        his wife, or companion, Emilie Schenkl, whom he had met during an
        earlier visit to Europe in 1934, gave birth to a baby girl in November
        1942. Identifying strongly with the Axis powers, Bose boarded a German
        submarine in February 1943. Off Madagascar, he was transferred to a
        Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra
        in May 1943. His wife, child, and 3,000 Indian men remained in
        Germany, the latter left to an uncertain future. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Indian National
        Army (INA) had been formed in 1942 from the Indian POWs of the British
        Indian army captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore.[32]
        After arrival in Singapore, Bose enlisted Indian civilians, chiefly
        Tamil ones, in Malaya and Singapore. The Japanese had come to support
        a number of puppet and provisional governments in the captured
        regions. With Japanese support, a Provisional Government of Free India
        under Bose was formed in the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar
        Islands. Although the Japanese military at all times exercised firm
        control over the islands, Bose's visit in December 1943 was widely
        publicized. Charismatic and driven, Bose displayed unflagging
        enthusiasm for the cause of liberating India. The INA under Bose
        became a model of diversity by region, ethnicity, religion, and
        gender. However, the Japanese considered Bose to be militarily
        unskilled and unrealistic, and Bose's military effort was short-lived.
        In late 1944 and early 1945, the British Indian Army first halted and
        then devastatingly reversed the Japanese attack on India. Almost half
        the Japanese forces and fully half the participating INA contingent
        were killed. The INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula and
        surrendered with the recapture of Singapore. Bose chose not to
        surrender with his forces or with the Japanese. He aimed to escape to
        Manchuria with a view to seeking a future in the Soviet Union which he
        believed to be turning anti-British. En route to Manchuria, his plane
        crashed in Taiwan, and he died from third-degree burns. Some Indians
        did not believe that the crash had occurred. Many among them,
        especially in Bengal, believed Bose would return to gain India's
        independence. <br />

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Indian National
        Congress, the main instrument of Indian nationalism, praised Bose's
        patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology, in
        particular his collaboration with fascism. The British Raj, never
        seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason
        in the INA trials, but eventually backtracked in the face both of
        popular sentiment and of its own end.
